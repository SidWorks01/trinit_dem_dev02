### 🕹️ Working

To find out the total number of emissions done by data uploaded and data downloaded we first recieved the number of packets through a function performance() , for stored data like that of drive , we made another function to handle them . These resources are then passed through a formula to Find out number of emissions and then these are stored in a database through a classification method stored in arrays.

Finally , we Bring out the light to our Extension page through Making a UI for showing Total Emissions and Emissions per session on the main screen along with Leaderboard Screen for all Ranking Webistes based off emissions and Statistics Page depicting numbe rof emissions on a session-to-session basis.
